	<h1>The weather project (2003) by Olafur Eliasson</h1>
	<h3>Created by Aleksandra Angelova</h3>
	<h3>Edited by Maria Bogdanova</h3>
			<p>Created for the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern, London, this site-specific installation employed a semi-circular screen, a ceiling of mirrors, and artificial mist to create the illusion of a sun. Aluminium frames lined with mirror foil were suspended from the ceiling to create a giant mirror that visually doubled the volume of the hall â€“ along with the semi-circular screen mounted on the far wall, its long edge abutting the mirror ceiling.</p>
